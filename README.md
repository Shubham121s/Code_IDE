# Code_IDE

## Description

Code_IDE is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application provides a platform for users to manage and work on their coding projects efficiently. It includes features such as project creation, management, and a user-friendly interface for interacting with the projects.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to build the server-side application.
- **React**: Front-end library used for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for executing the server-side code.
